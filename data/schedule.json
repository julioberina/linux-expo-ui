While many software stacks leverage Maven's strict semantics, its legacy release process withered under large, modern codebases.

We'll dive into the day-1 experience with both, and some advanced scenarios of using the service mesh. We'll compare this to border security with an app gateway, and compare and contrast the security features, complexities, and implementation costs. You'll leave with a concrete understanding of the benefits and tradeoffs you get when you pull in a service mesh, and be ready to justify the investment.\n",

We will focus on plain C, but much of the material will apply directly to C++. Some of it will even make you a better programmer in your favorite higher-level language.\n",
